    <h2><b>Doom<b></h2>

    <p>
    Doom is a first person shooter released in 1993 by ID-Software. In<br>
    Doom you run around shooting demons, collecting key cards, and exploring<br>
    the map. Doom is important because of it's use of binary space partitioning<br>
    which is a 3D rendering technique that subdivides sectors (or rooms) into<br>
    smaller bite sized pieces. Unlike other algorithms like painters algorithm,<br>
    BSP doesn't render on top of already rendered scenes. There are many other fun<br>
    facts I could rant on about but I think this is enough.

    <h2><b>Quake<b></h2>

    <p>
    Another game made by ID-Software, Quake, is an first person shooter game<br>
    similar to Doom. I really like Quake's medival or gothic aesthetic. Unlike<br>
    Doom, Quake doesn't have some of the technical limitations that the Doom<br>
    engine had such as sectors on top of sectors. While the Doom engine used<br>
    2D sprites, the Quake engine could render actual 3D graphics.

    <h2><b>Half Life</b></h2>

    <p>
    Halflife is a first person shooter game made by Valve in 1998. You play<br>
    as a Black Mesa scientist after you do some fuck ass expirements and <br>
    accidentaly open a gate to a planet called Xen and aliens come through<br>
    and you have to kill them. I really like Valve and theirs games. I love<br>
    Portal and Counter Strike aswell. All hail Gabe Newel.
